## Overview  
This project leverages computer vision techniques to classify plant leaves into healthy or diseased categories. The system processes images, applies machine learning algorithms, and predicts the disease type, if any. The model is trained on a curated dataset and evaluated for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

---

## Features  
- Preprocessing of plant leaf images (e.g., resizing, normalization).  
- Classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
- Visualization of results with performance metrics and sample predictions.  
- Supports batch processing of multiple images.  

---

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - TensorFlow/Keras for building and training the model  
  - OpenCV for image preprocessing  
  - NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation  
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization  
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset  
The dataset used for this project consists of labeled images of healthy and diseased plant leaves. It is structured into `train` and `test` directories. Each subfolder represents a category (e.g., healthy, diseased).  

You can download the dataset [here](#). *(Replace `#` with the dataset link, if applicable.)*

## Installation  
To set up this project on your local system, follow these steps:  

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Plant-Leaf-Disease-Detection.git
   cd Plant-Leaf-Disease-Detection
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install all required libraries using the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. **Set Up the Dataset**:
   Place the dataset in the dataset/ directory in the following structure:

dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── category_1/
│   ├── category_2/
│   └── ...
└── test/
    ├── category_1/
    ├── category_2/
    └── ...
## Usage
1. **Preprocess the Images**:  
   Run the preprocessing script to prepare the images for training:  
   ```bash
   python src/preprocessing.py
2. **Train the Model**:
   Execute the training script to build the classification model:
   ```bash
   python src/model_training.py
3. **Evaluate the Model**:
   Test the model using the test dataset to evaluate its performance:
   ```bash
   python src/evaluate.py
4. **Predict New Images**:
   Use the trained model to predict the class of a new image:
   ```bash
   python src/predict.py --image <path_to_image>
